# SAP Feedback Generator

### Rationale

SAP stands for Students as Partners, and I firmly believe that students being a partner in their learning is essential for creating an environment where students can thrive and are empowered.
One easy way for students to be a partner in the classroom is by edcators facilitating regular surveys for students to provide feedback.

However, for many educators, analysing such survey data can be quite difficult and time consuming. The SAP Feedback Generator is designed to streamline this process by making it easy for 
educators to quickly anlayse data from their students.

### Active Development
